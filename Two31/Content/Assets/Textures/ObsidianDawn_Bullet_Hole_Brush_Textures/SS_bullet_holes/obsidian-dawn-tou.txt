    * You may NOT repackage and redistribute our resources in any way, shape or form.

    * You may NOT plop a brush down onto a plain background, with nothing else on the page, and redistribute it or sell it. This is the same as redistributing the brushes/images themselves.

    * You MAY use our resources within your own design, painting, etc and do whatever you like with it (provided that proper credit is given, as below).

    * You MAY NOT redistribute any of our designs as rubber stamps. We have plans to do this in the future.

PROVIDING CREDIT:

    * Provide credit to us somewhere, either as “Obsidian Dawn” or www.obsidiandawn.com

    * If possible, please provide a link back here, so that others know where you found the brushes and can get a set of their very own! The link should go to: http://www.obsidiandawn.com

    * If you use these brushes or patterns commercially, credit us in whatever way that you can. If you’re a digital scrapbooker, most people list credit and the website URL in their TOU text file that comes with the download. 

      If you cannot provide credit and want clear-cut rights to be able to use these brushes in your designs, you may purchase a commercial license (http://www.obsidiandawn.com/commercial-licenses).

    * That's it! Enjoy!
